# Magic Smart Ball
Magic 8-Ball that can discern the general nature of inputs given and respond (more or less) accordingly.
Feature: It has a bit of an attitude problem.

Future developments:
-Add a fading in/fading out effect for the oracle message
-Move the possible outputs to an external text file and have them read into arrays from there
-Maybe add more outputs
-Improve mobile responsiveness (make it prettier)
